          <p>
            The wine is produced from handpicked Sangiovese grapes in small crates and undergo further selection in the cellar. Skin maceration has an average length of 15- 20 days, during this period its alcoholic fermentation is completed at a controlled temperature of 27 degrees. Daily pumpovers and delestage are finalized for a greater extraction.

          <h5>Ageing</h5>
          <p>
            The wine is poured in stainless steel tanks where the malolactic fermentation happens. At a later time it is placed in French Oak Barrels where it ages for 30 months. At the end of this period the wine is bottled, undergoes further ageing and then is placed on the market.

          <h5>Tasting notes</h5>
          <p>
            Intense ruby red colour. Elegant with a distinctive aroma of red berries and blackberry and violet notes. The elevation in oak barrels adds complexity and vanilla fragrances. The taste has a broad and tangy character and conferms the aromatic balance revealed by the scent, and a long and persistant taste.
            Serving temperature : 18Â°C.
